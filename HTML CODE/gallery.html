            In 2002, Norah Jones exploded into the national consciousness with
            her diamond-certified, multi-Grammy-winning debut, Come Away With
            Me, on Blue Note Records. Since then, Jones, raised near Dallas and
            the daughter of Indian sitar legend Ravi Shankar, has dropped three
            more LPs, an album of duets with the likes of Ray Charles and hero
            Willie Nelson, starred in the indie film My Blueberry Nights, and
            recorded two discs with her country side project, the Little
            Willies, who brought the new For the Good Times to South by
            Southwest.

          Released in 2002, Come Away With Me was an instant success, selling
          18 million copies and winning eight Grammy awards (a trophy for
          every category it was nominated in). Jones was just 23 at the time,
          and says it took "a few years" to gain perspective. "It's funny how
          that works," she says. "You're in this amazing moment that you've
          fantasised about for your whole life but you don't get to enjoy it.
          All of a sudden you're like, 'Blargh! I don't know what's going on
          but this is stressing me out.'"
