              In 2002, Norah Jones exploded into the national consciousness with her diamond-certified, multi-Grammy-winning debut, Come Away With Me, on Blue Note Records. Since then, Jones, raised near Dallas and the daughter of Indian sitar legend Ravi Shankar, has dropped three more LPs, an album of duets with the likes of Ray Charles and hero Willie Nelson, starred in the indie film My Blueberry Nights, and recorded two discs with her country side project, the Little Willies, who brought the new For the Good Times to South by Southwest.

            Released in 2002, Come Away With Me was an instant success, selling
            18 million copies and winning eight Grammy awards (a trophy for
            every category it was nominated in). Jones was just 23 at the time,
            and says it took "a few years" to gain perspective. "It's funny how
            that works," she says. "You're in this amazing moment that you've
            fantasised about for your whole life but you don't get to enjoy it.
            All of a sudden you're like, 'Blargh! I don't know what's going on
            but this is stressing me out.'"
