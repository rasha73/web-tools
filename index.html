            Norah Jones (born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar; March 30, 1979) is an
            American singer, songwriter, and pianist. She has won several awards
            for her music and, as of 2012, had sold more than 50 million records
            worldwide. Billboard named her the top jazz artist of the 2000's
            decade. She has won nine Grammy Awards and was ranked 60th on
            Billboard magazine's artists of the 2000s decade chart.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2002, Jones launched her solo music career with the release of Come
            Away with Me, which was a fusion of jazz with country, blues, folk and
            pop. It was certified diamond, selling over 27 million copies. The
            record earned Jones five Grammy Awards, including the Album of the
            Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist. Her subsequent studio
            albums—Feels Like Home (2004), Not Too Late (2007), and The Fall
            (2009)—all gained platinum status, selling over a million copies each.
            They were also generally well received by critics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jones's fifth studio album, Little Broken Hearts, was released on
            April 27, 2012; her sixth, Day Breaks, was released on October 7,
            2016. Her seventh studio album, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, was released
            on June 12, 2020. Jones made her feature film debut as an actress in
            My Blueberry Nights, which was released in 2007 and was directed by
            Wong Kar-Wai. Jones is the daughter of Indian sitarist and composer
            Ravi Shankar and concert producer Sue Jones, and is the half-sister of
            fellow musicians Anoushka Shankar and Shubhendra Shankar.

          <h3>Early life</h3>
          <p>
            Jones was born Geethali Norah Jones Shankar on March 30, 1979, in
            Manhattan, New York City, to American concert producer Sue Jones and
            Indian Bengali musician Ravi Shankar. After her parents separated in
            1986, Jones lived with her mother, growing up in Grapevine, Texas. As
            a child, Jones began singing in church and also took piano and voice
            lessons. She attended Colleyville Middle School and Grapevine High
            School before transferring to Booker T. Washington High School for the
            Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas. Her music took its first form
            early on in the local Methodist Church where she regularly sang solos.
            While in high school, she sang in the school choir, participated in
            band, and played the alto saxophone. At the age of 16, with both
            parents' consent, she officially changed her name to Norah Jones,
            removing the Indian elements from her name.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jones always had an affinity for the music of Bill Evans and Billie
            Holiday, among other "oldies". She once said, "My mom had this
            eight-album Billie Holiday set; I picked out one disc that I liked and
            played that over and over again". She attended Interlochen Center for
            the Arts during the summers. While at high school, she won the Down
            Beat Student Music Awards for Best Jazz Vocalist (twice, in 1996 and
            1997) and Best Original Composition (1996).
          </p>
          <p>
            Jones attended the University of North Texas (UNT), where she majored
            in jazz piano and sang with the UNT Jazz Singers. During this time,
            she had a chance meeting with future collaborator Jesse Harris. She
            gave a ride to a band playing at the university whose members happened
            to be friends of Harris. He was on a cross-country road trip with
            friend and future Little Willies member Richard Julian, and stopped to
            see the band play. After meeting Jones, Harris started sending her
            lead sheets of his songs. In 1999, Jones left Texas for New York City.
            Less than a year later, she started a band with Harris, and her
            recordings with them were bestsellers.
